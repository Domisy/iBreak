iBreak version 1.1 PR
Created by the Domisy Dev Team
The goal of iBreak is to combine all popular jailbreak tools into one easy to use package.

Depending on the device you use, you will need either the packaged versions of Redsn0w, sn0wbreeze or iBooty.

But, you know what? Before you would have had to download them all seperately, but now they are all in one easy-to-use package!

Just follow the prompts about your device and iOS version, and the proper tool will be selected automagically.
